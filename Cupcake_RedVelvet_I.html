          <h2 class="html">Ingredients:</h2>
         <h3 class="html">For the sponge cake:</h3>
		   <p>60 g of butter at room temperature</p>
		   <p>150 g of white sugar</p>
		   <p>1 egg</p>
		   <p>10 g of cocoa powder without sugar</p>
		   <p>1 teaspoon of red pasta dye (Sugarflair Extra Red)</p>
		   <p>120 ml of milk</p>
		   <p>150 g of flour</p>
		   <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
		   <p>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</p>
		   <p>1 1/2 teaspoons white vinegar</p>
		   <p>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
		   <h3 class="html">For the cream of cheese glaze:</h3>
           <p>50 g of unsalted butter, at room temperature</p>
		   <p>300 g of icing sugar (or icing sugar)</p>
		   <p>125 g of cream cheese type Philadelphia, cold</p>
            <h2 class="html">Preparation:</h2>
		   <p>With the help of an electric mixer with barillas and at medium speed, beat the butter and sugar until the mixture is creamy. We add the egg and continue beating until it is fully integrated.</p>
		   <p>In another bowl we beat the cocoa powder, the red dye and the vanilla extract. We add it to the previous mix and beat until everything is well integrated.</p>
		   <p>At low speed we add little by little and alternating milk and flour, and we beat well. Finally add the salt, baking soda and vinegar and beat until the dough is well uniform.</p>
		   <p> We distribute the mixture between the paper capsules taking into account that we should only fill up to 2/3 of height.</p>
		   <p>We bake for 20-25 minutes or until we see that the cupcakes begin to brown. We can also do the test by clicking with a toothpick in the center of one of the cupcakes and if it comes out clean is that they are ready.</p>
		   <p>We take them out of the oven and let them cool for 5 minutes in the mold and then completely on a rack.</p>
		   <h3 class="html">For the cream cheese glaze:</h3>
		   <p>We beat the Icing Sugar and the butter with an electric mixer with barillas, at low speed, until they are well mixed. Add the cream cheese and beat until it is incorporated, but without beating excessively so that the cream is not too liquid.</p>
		   <p>* If we use icing sugar instead of Icing Sugar to prepare the glaze, we may notice a somewhat grainy texture. There is a huge difference compared to the Icing Sugar which is much thinner.</p>
